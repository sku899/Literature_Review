## Contents

### 1. **SabinaKu_Modern_Anatomy_Education_Essay_07April2016.pdf**
**Topic:** Anatomy Education  
This essay examines the historical and contemporary role of cadaver dissection in anatomy teaching. It traces the practice back to the 16th and 17th centuries and discusses current challenges such as limited cadaver availability, curriculum time constraints, and the rise of 3D imaging technologies. The review advocates for curriculum reform that balances tradition with innovation, aiming to improve teaching effectiveness in terms of both time and cost.

### 2. **SabinaKu_MSc_MedVis_Anatomy_Dissertation_Aug2016.pdf**
**Title:** *Virtual Reality Interactive Games in Stroke Rehabilitation – a Pilot Study*  
**Topic:** Stroke Rehabilitation (Chapter 2)  
This MSc dissertation includes a literature review on stroke rehabilitation principles and recovery mechanisms. It highlights limitations of conventional therapy and explores the potential of virtual reality (VR) as a novel intervention. The study also presents the development of a Leap Motion Controller (LMC)-based system for upper limb rehabilitation, showcasing the promise of gamified VR in clinical settings.

### 3. **SabinaKu_Epilepsy_review_27Oct2020.pdf**
**Topic:** Epilepsy Management  
This review discusses current treatment strategies, cost implications, and challenges in managing epilepsy. It emphasizes the role of EEG in diagnosis and monitoring, and explores how machine learning could enhance epilepsy care—particularly in predicting seizure recurrence and patient response to anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs).
